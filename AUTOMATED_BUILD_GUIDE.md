# Comprehensive testing
matrix:
  config: [
    {"api": 24, "arch": "x86", "target": "default"},
    {"api": 30, "arch": "x86_64", "target": "google_apis"},
    {"api": 34, "arch": "x86_64", "target": "google_apis"}
  ]
```

### 4. APK Analysis & Optimization (`apk_analysis.yml`)

**Key Features**:
- **Size Analysis**: APK size tracking and comparison
- **Performance Analysis**: Build performance profiling
- **Security Analysis**: APK security feature verification
- **Optimization Recommendations**: Automated suggestions for improvements
- **Historical Tracking**: Size and performance trend analysis

## üõ†Ô∏è Supporting Tools

### Build Performance Monitor (`scripts/build-performance-monitor.sh`)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive build performance analysis and optimization

**Features**:
- Build time measurement and tracking
- Dependency analysis and reporting
- Cache effectiveness monitoring
- Performance optimization recommendations
- Historical performance tracking
- Interactive dashboard generation

**Usage**:
```bash
./scripts/build-performance-monitor.sh
```

**Outputs**:
- Performance reports in `build-reports/`
- Build time CSV tracking
- Optimization recommendations
- Interactive HTML dashboard

### Security Configuration

**Dependency Check Suppressions** (`CleverFerret/dependency-check-suppressions.xml`):
- Configured for Android-specific false positive suppression
- Regular review schedule for security vulnerabilities
- Documentation for each suppression

3. **Performance Insights**: Build performance monitoring and optimization
4. **Security**: Automated vulnerability scanning and code analysis

### Release Management Benefits

1. **Automated Releases**: One-click or tag-based release creation
2. **Quality Control**: Comprehensive pre-release validation
3. **Documentation**: Auto-generated changelogs and installation guides
4. **Traceability**: Complete build and release audit trail

### User Benefits

1. **Reliability**: Thoroughly tested APKs across multiple devices
2. **Security**: Signed APKs with integrity verification
3. **Performance**: Optimized build artifacts
4. **Documentation**: Clear installation and troubleshooting guides

## üîß Configuration

### Repository Secrets (Optional)

For enhanced functionality, configure these secrets:

```yaml
# For release signing (production)
KEYSTORE_PASSWORD: "your-keystore-password"
KEY_ALIAS: "your-key-alias"
KEY_PASSWORD: "your-key-password"

# For enhanced dependency scanning
NVD_API_KEY: "your-nvd-api-key"
```

### Workflow Customization

Each workflow can be customized through:

1. **Environment Variables**: Modify resource allocation and build settings
2. **Matrix Configuration**: Adjust tested API levels and architectures
3. **Trigger Configuration**: Customize when workflows run
4. **Artifact Retention**: Adjust storage duration for build artifacts

- **Retry Logic**: 3-attempt retry for flaky tests

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Enable Workflows

The workflows are automatically available after merge. They will trigger on:
- Push to main/develop branches
- Pull requests to main
- Git tags starting with 'v'

### 2. Monitor Performance

Use the build performance monitor:
```bash
./scripts/build-performance-monitor.sh
```

### 3. Create Releases

Tag a commit to trigger automated release:
```bash
git tag v1.1.0
git push origin v1.1.0
```

Or use manual workflow dispatch for custom releases.

### 4. Review Reports

Check GitHub Actions for:
- Build performance reports
- Test results and coverage
- APK analysis and optimization recommendations
- Security scan results

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Timeouts**: Increase timeout values in workflow configuration
2. **Cache Misses**: Check cache key configuration and dependencies
3. **Emulator Failures**: Review emulator configuration and KVM setup
4. **APK Signing**: Verify signing configuration and secrets

### Performance Optimization

1. **Enable Gradle Daemon**: Configured by default
2. **Use Build Cache**: Enabled with `--build-cache` flag
3. **Parallel Execution**: Configured with optimal worker count
4. **Resource Allocation**: 4GB JVM heap for optimal performance
