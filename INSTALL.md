# Universal Media Library - Installation Guide

## System Requirements

- Android 7.0 (API level 24) or higher
- At least 100 MB of free storage space

## Installation

1. Download the latest APK from the [Releases](https://github.com/Kaleaon/Android-calibre/releases) section
2. Enable "Install from unknown sources" in your Android settings if not already enabled
3. Open the downloaded APK file and follow the installation prompts

## First Run

When you first open the Universal Media Library app, you'll see an empty library screen. This is the intended first-run state.

### Getting Started

You have two main options to populate your library:

#### Option 1: Create a New Library
1. Tap the "+" button to create a new library
2. Enter a name for your library
3. Start adding media items manually

#### Option 2: Import from Calibre
1. Tap the menu button (⋮) in the top bar
2. Select "Import Calibre Library"
3. Choose your Calibre `metadata.db` file
4. Select the root folder of your Calibre library
5. The app will import your existing books and metadata

### Features Available in v1.0

- ✅ Basic library management interface
- ✅ Calibre library import
- ✅ Modern Material You design
- ✅ Local database storage
- ⏳ More features coming in future releases

## Troubleshooting

### App Won't Install
- Make sure you have enough storage space
- Verify your Android version is 7.0 or higher
- Check that "Install from unknown sources" is enabled

### Empty Library
This is expected behavior on first run. Use one of the methods above to add content to your library.
