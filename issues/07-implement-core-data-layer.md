# Issue: Implement Core Data Layer and Calibre Importer

**Status:** Completed

## User Story
As a developer, I need to build the core database and the Calibre import functionality so that the application can store and manage user data effectively, starting with a seamless import experience for Calibre users.

## Acceptance Criteria
- **Benefit for the user:** This is a foundational feature that enables the entire application to function. For the user, the most immediate benefit is the ability to import their existing Calibre library, getting them up and running in the new app quickly and easily.
- **Ease of use:** The implementation should be robust and performant, ensuring the app feels fast and reliable when managing data.
- **Criteria:**
    - [x] The database schema from `DATABASE_SCHEMA.md` is implemented in Kotlin using Android's native SQLite libraries.
    - [x] All database tables (Libraries, MediaItems, Metadata, etc.) are created.
    - [x] The Calibre importer is built, following the logic from `IMPORT_LOGIC.md`.
    - [x] The importer correctly connects to a `metadata.db` file, reads the data, and applies the defined cleaning rules.
    - [x] Cleaned data is correctly inserted into the new application's database.
    - [x] Unit tests are created to verify the data transformation and insertion logic.

## Details
This task involves the implementation of the designs created in Phase 2.

- **Technology Stack**: Kotlin, Android SQLite.
- **Scope**:
    1.  **Database Implementation**: Translate the table structure defined in `DATABASE_SCHEMA.md` into `CREATE TABLE` statements and corresponding data access objects (DAOs).
    2.  **Calibre Importer**:
        - Build the UI for file selection (`metadata.db` and library root folder).
        - Implement the connection to the external Calibre database.
        - Code the data transformation logic for authors, titles, and file paths as specified in `IMPORT_LOGIC.md`.
        - Implement the insertion of transformed data into the app's database, including conflict resolution (skipping duplicates).
