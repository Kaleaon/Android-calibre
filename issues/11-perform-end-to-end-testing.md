# Issue: Perform End-to-End Testing

**Status:** Not Started

## User Story
As a user, I want the application to be reliable, stable, and performant, so I can trust it with my media library without worrying about crashes or data loss.

## Acceptance Criteria
- **Benefit for the user:** Thorough testing ensures a high-quality, bug-free application, leading to a smooth and frustration-free user experience.
- **Ease of use:** A well-tested app "just works," which is the easiest experience a user can have.
- **Criteria:**
    - [ ] End-to-end tests are performed on the entire application flow.
    - [ ] Special attention is paid to the performance of the `epub4j` reader component.
    - [ ] The accuracy of the automated data correction engine (ML Kit and OpenNLP) is tested and validated.
    - [ ] Performance testing is conducted on large libraries to identify and fix bottlenecks.
    - [ ] Bugs and issues found during testing are documented and fixed.

## Details
This phase is focused on ensuring the quality and stability of the application before a public release.

- **Key Areas of Focus**:
    1.  **E-Reader Performance**: Test with various `.epub` files (including large ones and those with complex formatting) to ensure smooth rendering and pagination with `epub4j`.
    2.  **Data Correction Accuracy**: Create a test suite of media files with known metadata errors. Run the automated correction engine and measure its accuracy. Identify common failure points and refine the algorithms.
    3.  **Database Performance**: Test the app's performance with a large, simulated library (e.g., 10,000+ items). Measure query times and identify any performance bottlenecks in the database layer.
    4.  **UI Responsiveness**: Test the UI on various devices and screen sizes to ensure it is responsive and free of visual glitches.
