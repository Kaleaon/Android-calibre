# Issue: Refine UI and User Experience

**Status:** Not Started

## User Story
As a user, I want the app to feel polished, smooth, and delightful to use, so that managing and consuming my media becomes a joy, not a chore.

## Acceptance Criteria
- **Benefit for the user:** This final layer of polish is what separates a functional app from a great one. It improves user satisfaction and makes the app feel professional and high-quality.
- **Ease of use:** A refined UI is inherently easier to use. It feels responsive, provides clear feedback, and guides the user naturally through the application.
- **Criteria:**
    - [ ] The overall UI is reviewed for consistency and adherence to Material You design principles.
    - [ ] Animations and transitions are added to improve the user experience.
    - [ ] User feedback from testing is incorporated to address any usability issues.
    - [ ] The app's performance is optimized to ensure a smooth and fluid experience.
    - [ ] The final UI feels polished and professional.

## Details
This task is about adding the final layer of polish to the application based on the results of end-to-end testing and user feedback.

- **Scope**:
    1.  **Visual Polish**:
        - Review all screens for consistent use of color, typography, and spacing.
        - Add subtle animations and transitions to make the UI feel more alive and responsive (e.g., screen transitions, button press effects).
    2.  **Usability Improvements**:
        - Analyze feedback from testers to identify areas of confusion or frustration in the UI.
        - Make iterative improvements to the UI layout and flow to address these issues.
    3.  **Performance Optimization**:
        - Profile the application to identify and fix any sources of jank or lag in the UI.
        - Optimize image loading, list scrolling, and other performance-critical areas.
