# Issue: [Feature] Deep Visual Controls for E-Reader

**Status:** Not Started

## User Story
As a reader, I want to have granular control over the visual presentation of my e-books, so I can customize the reading experience to my exact preferences for maximum comfort and readability.

## Acceptance Criteria
- **Benefit for the user:** This level of customization allows users to tailor the reading experience to their specific needs (e.g., for accessibility reasons like dyslexia or low vision) and personal preferences, making reading more enjoyable.
- **Ease of use:** These controls should be located in an intuitive settings panel within the reader, with clear labels and immediate feedback as the user makes changes.
- **Criteria:**
    - [ ] The user can adjust the line space.
    - [ ] The user can adjust the font scale.
    - [ ] The user can toggle bold and italic styles for the entire text.
    - [ ] The user can adjust the text and background colors (alpha colors).
    - [ ] The user can control the fading edge effect.
    - [ ] A settings panel for these controls is available in the e-reader view.

## Details
This feature is inspired by the advanced customization options in Moon+ Reader. It involves adding a settings panel to the `epub4j`-based reader that allows the user to modify various rendering options in real-time.

- **Implementation**:
    - These settings will need to be saved on a per-user or per-book basis.
    - The `epub4j` rendering component will need to be configured to apply these visual styles to the displayed text.
