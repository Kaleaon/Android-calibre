# Issue: [Feature] Advanced Paging Options

**Status:** Not Started

## User Story
As a reader, I want to be able to turn pages using a method that is most convenient for me, whether it's tapping the screen, using volume keys, or custom gestures, so I can read comfortably in any situation (e.g., one-handed).

## Acceptance Criteria
- **Benefit for the user:** This feature provides significant ergonomic benefits, allowing the user to control the app in the way that best suits their physical needs and reading habits.
- **Ease of use:** The default paging options should be intuitive, and the customization screen should make it easy to remap keys and gestures.
- **Criteria:**
    - [ ] The user can turn pages by tapping the edges of the screen.
    - [ ] The user can turn pages using the device's volume keys.
    - [ ] A settings screen is available to customize paging behavior.
    - [ ] On the settings screen, the user can assign different actions (e.g., next page, previous page, scroll) to volume keys and screen tap zones.
    - [ ] The user can define custom gestures for paging (e.g., swipe left/right).

## Details
This feature provides deep customization of the app's input controls for turning pages.

- **Implementation**:
    - The e-reader view will need to handle touch events for screen taps and gestures.
    - The application will need to capture volume key presses and prevent the system's default volume change behavior while the reader is active.
    - A new settings screen will be required to manage the key and gesture mappings. These settings need to be stored as user preferences.
