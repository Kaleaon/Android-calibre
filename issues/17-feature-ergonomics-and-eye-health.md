# Issue: [Feature] Ergonomics & Eye Health

**Status:** Not Started

## User Story
As a reader who spends a lot of time reading on my device, I want convenient ways to adjust brightness and features that remind me to take breaks, so I can read comfortably for long sessions without straining my eyes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- **Benefit for the user:** These features directly contribute to the user's physical comfort and health, reducing eye strain and fatigue during long reading sessions.
- **Ease of use:** The brightness control should be an intuitive gesture, and the eye health reminders should be helpful without being annoying.
- **Criteria:**
    - [ ] The user can adjust the screen brightness by sliding a finger along the edge of the screen.
    - [ ] An optional "Keep your eyes health" feature is available in settings.
    - [ ] When enabled, this feature provides periodic reminders or visual cues to encourage the user to take a break from reading.
    - [ ] The user can customize the frequency and type of these reminders.

## Details
This task focuses on ergonomic features that make long reading sessions more comfortable and healthier for the user.

- **Implementation**:
    1.  **Brightness Control**:
        - This will involve detecting a vertical swipe gesture along the left or right edge of the reader view.
        - The gesture should then programmatically adjust the screen's brightness. This may require overlay permissions.
    2.  **"Keep your eyes health" Feature**:
        - This will be a time-based service that runs while the reader is active.
        - When a set interval is reached (e.g., 30 minutes), it will trigger a non-intrusive notification or a subtle animation on the screen.
        - The user preferences for this feature (enabled/disabled, interval) need to be stored.
