# Issue: [Feature] Realistic Page-Turning Animations

**Status:** Not Started

## User Story
As a reader, I want to see a pleasant and realistic page-turning animation when I go to the next page, so that the reading experience feels more like a real book and is more visually engaging.

## Acceptance Criteria
- **Benefit for the user:** This adds a layer of visual polish and delight to the reading experience, making the app feel more premium and immersive.
- **Ease of use:** The animation should be smooth and performant, enhancing the experience without causing lag. The user should be able to disable it if they prefer a simpler transition.
- **Criteria:**
    - [ ] A realistic page-turning animation (e.g., a curling page effect) is implemented.
    - [ ] The animation is smooth and does not negatively impact performance.
    - [ ] An option is available in the settings to disable the animation and use a simpler slide or fade transition instead.

## Details
This feature is purely for visual polish and to enhance the reading experience.

- **Implementation**:
    - This is a complex UI task. It may require a custom View or Composable that can render the page content onto a surface that can be manipulated to create the curling effect.
    - Libraries like `react-native-page-turn` or `turn.js` can serve as inspiration, but a native Android solution will need to be found or created.
    - Performance is critical. The animation should be implemented efficiently to avoid jank and high battery usage.
