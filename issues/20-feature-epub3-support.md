# Issue: [Feature] EPUB3 Support (Multimedia Content)

**Status:** Not Started

## User Story
As a user, I want the app to correctly display the rich multimedia content, like videos and audio clips, that are embedded in modern EPUB3 files, so I can have the full, intended reading experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
- **Benefit for the user:** This ensures compatibility with modern e-book standards and allows users to enjoy the enhanced, interactive content that authors and publishers are increasingly including in their books.
- **Ease of use:** Multimedia content should play inline, directly within the reader view, without requiring the user to open a separate app.
- **Criteria:**
    - [ ] The `epub4j` integration is capable of parsing EPUB3 files.
    - [ ] Video content embedded in an EPUB3 file is correctly identified and displayed.
    - [ ] Audio content embedded in an EPUB3 file is correctly identified and displayed.
    - [ ] The user can play and pause the embedded multimedia content from within the reader view.

## Details
This feature ensures the e-reader is future-proof and can handle the modern EPUB3 standard.

- **Implementation**:
    - The core of this task is to verify and, if necessary, extend the `epub4j` integration to handle the specific tags and structures used for multimedia in EPUB3.
    - The e-reader's rendering component will need to be able to embed native video and audio player views (using ExoPlayer and the app's audio player component) within the book's content.
    - This will require a way to bridge the gap between the parsed book content (HTML-like) and native Android player components.
