# Issue: [Feature] Cloud Sync

**Status:** Not Started

## User Story
As a user with multiple devices, I want the app to synchronize my library, reading positions, and settings across all my devices, so I can seamlessly switch between my phone and tablet without losing my place.

## Acceptance Criteria
- **Benefit for the user:** This is a critical feature for users with more than one device. It provides a seamless and consistent experience, allowing them to pick up right where they left off, regardless of which device they are using. It also serves as a backup for their data.
- **Ease of use:** The user should be able to link their cloud storage account easily from the app's settings. The synchronization process should be automatic and run in the background.
- **Criteria:**
    - [ ] The user can link a cloud storage provider (e.g., Dropbox, WebDav) to the app.
    - [ ] The app can backup and restore its settings to the cloud.
    - [ ] Reading positions, highlights, and notes are automatically synchronized across devices.
    - [ ] The sync process is efficient and handles conflicts gracefully (e.g., by merging or using the latest change).

## Details
This is a complex feature that provides multi-device support and data backup.

- **Implementation**:
    - **Cloud Service Integration**: This will require integrating the APIs of the chosen cloud storage providers (e.g., Dropbox API, or a generic WebDav client).
    - **Data Serialization**: A mechanism will be needed to serialize the relevant data (settings, reading progress, annotations) into a format that can be stored in the cloud (e.g., JSON or a small database file).
    - **Sync Logic**: This is the most complex part. The app needs to detect changes locally, upload them to the cloud, check for remote changes, and download and apply them locally. A robust conflict resolution strategy is essential.
    - **Background Service**: The sync process should run periodically in the background without requiring the user to initiate it manually.
