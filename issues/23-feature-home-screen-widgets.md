# Issue: [Feature] Home Screen Widgets

**Status:** Not Started

## User Story
As a user, I want to be able to place a widget on my home screen that shows my recent or favorite books, so I can quickly jump back into reading without having to open the full app first.

## Acceptance Criteria
- **Benefit for the user:** Widgets provide a convenient, "at a glance" view of the user's library and quick access to their books right from the home screen, making the app more integrated into their daily device usage.
- **Ease of use:** The widget should be easy to add and configure. It should update automatically to reflect the user's recent reading activity.
- **Criteria:**
    - [ ] An Android home screen widget is created for the application.
    - [ ] The widget displays a "shelf" of books, showing their cover art.
    - [ ] The user can configure the widget to show recently read books or favorite books.
    - [ ] Tapping on a book cover in the widget opens the book directly in the e-reader.
    - [ ] The widget's content is updated periodically in the background.

## Details
This feature involves creating a home screen widget to provide quick access to the user's library.

- **Implementation**:
    - This will require using Android's `AppWidgetProvider` framework.
    - A background service will be needed to update the widget's content periodically (e.g., when a book is closed or when the library is updated).
    - The widget's UI will be built using `RemoteViews`.
    - A configuration activity will be needed to allow the user to choose what the widget displays (e.g., recents vs. favorites).

## Dependencies
