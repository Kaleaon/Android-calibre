# Issue: [Feature] Advanced PDF Support

**Status:** Not Started

## User Story
As a user who has many books and documents in PDF format, I want a high-performance PDF reader with annotation support, so I can manage and read my PDFs within the same app I use for all my other media.

## Acceptance Criteria
- **Benefit for the user:** This feature makes the app a truly universal media library by adding robust support for the extremely common PDF format. Users will no longer need a separate app for their PDF documents.
- **Ease of use:** The PDF reading experience should be smooth and fast, even for large and complex files. Annotation tools should be as easy to use as they are for e-books.
- **Criteria:**
    - [ ] A high-performance PDF rendering engine is integrated into the app.
    - [ ] The user can open and read PDF files from their library.
    - [ ] The PDF reader supports smooth scrolling and zooming.
    - [ ] The user can highlight text and add notes to PDF files (annotation support).
    - [ ] The performance is acceptable even for large, image-heavy PDF files.

## Details
This feature adds first-class support for reading and annotating PDF files. This is a significant undertaking as PDF rendering is complex.

- **Implementation**:
    - **PDF Engine**: This is the most critical decision. A robust, open-source PDF rendering library for Android needs to be selected (e.g., `AndroidPdfViewer` or a native solution based on `PdfRenderer`). Performance and license compatibility are key criteria.
    - **Annotation Layer**: An overlay will need to be built on top of the PDF view to handle the drawing and interaction for highlights and notes.
    - **Database**: The annotation data for PDFs will need to be stored in the database, similar to how it's done for e-books.
