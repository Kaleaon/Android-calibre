# Issue: [Feature] Security (Password Protection)

**Status:** Not Started

## User Story
As a user who may share my device with others, I want the option to set a password to protect the app at startup, so I can keep my reading library private.

## Acceptance Criteria
- **Benefit for the user:** This provides a layer of privacy and security, giving users peace of mind that their library and reading habits are not accessible to others who may use their device.
- **Ease of use:** The user should be able to enable password protection and set their password easily from the app's settings. The password prompt at startup should be clear and simple.
- **Criteria:**
    - [ ] A setting is available to enable password protection.
    - [ ] When enabled, the user is prompted to set a password.
    - [ ] On subsequent launches, the app displays a password prompt before showing any content.
    - [ ] The app provides a way for the user to change or disable the password.
    - [ ] The password is stored securely (e.g., using Android's Keystore system).

## Details
This feature adds an optional layer of security to the application.

- **Implementation**:
    - **Password Storage**: The password must not be stored in plain text. Android's Keystore system should be used to securely store the user's password hash.
    - **Startup Flow**: The application's startup logic will need to be modified. If password protection is enabled, a dedicated password entry screen must be shown before the main UI is loaded.
    - **Settings UI**: A new settings screen will be needed for the user to manage their password (set, change, disable).
